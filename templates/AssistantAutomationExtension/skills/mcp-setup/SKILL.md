# MCP setup

Use this skill when the `extension-docs` assistant docs MCP tool is missing or when the agent runtime does not have the assistant MCP server configured.

## Restore the assistant MCP server

1. Find the MCP client configuration used by your agent framework or editor.
2. Ensure it defines an `assistant` server entry.
3. If the server entry is missing, recreate it from this template's `.vscode/mcp.json` or copy the equivalent values into your framework's MCP configuration format.
4. Confirm the server launches `assistant` with args `["mcp"]`.
5. Reload or restart the agent runtime after updating the MCP configuration if required.

## Required server values

- Server name: `assistant`
- Transport: `stdio`
- Command: `assistant`
- Args: `mcp`

## Example from this template

The template includes this example in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "assistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "assistant",
      "args": [
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why this matters

The assistant MCP server exposes the `extension-docs` tool, which gives current guidance for building Assistant extensions.
