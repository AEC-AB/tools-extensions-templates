# Docs routing

Resolve the documentation root before reading platform guidance.

1. Identify the active project file (.csproj) and work from its directory. Ensure obj/project.assets.json exists; if it is missing, run:

~~~powershell
dotnet restore "<project.csproj>"
~~~

2. Query the generated documentation path first:

~~~powershell
dotnet msbuild "<project.csproj>" -getProperty:CWAssistantExtensionDocsPath
~~~

Record the raw property result. Resolve a relative value against the project directory. Accept the value only when it is an existing directory containing AGENT.md; use it as ExtensionDocsRoot.

3. When the property is empty or fails that validation, use the active restore metadata:

- Search only obj/project.assets.json for CW.Assistant.Extensions.Docs/ and capture the exact resolved version from the library key (for example, CW.Assistant.Extensions.Docs/26.10.0).
- Search the same file for packageFolders and capture every package root.
- For each package root, construct:

~~~text
<packageRoot>/cw.assistant.extensions.docs/<resolvedVersion>/contentFiles/any/any/Resources/ExtensionDocs
~~~

- Accept a candidate only when it is an existing directory containing AGENT.md; use it as ExtensionDocsRoot.

4. If no candidate passes validation, stop and report all of the following:

- The raw CWAssistantExtensionDocsPath property result.
- The exact CW.Assistant.Extensions.Docs/<version> entry found, or that the docs package entry is missing.
- Every packageFolders root examined.
- The resolved platform extension package (for example, CW.Assistant.Extensions.Revit.2026) and CW.Assistant.Extensions.Contracts versions.
- This recovery guidance:

~~~powershell
dotnet restore "<project.csproj>" --force-evaluate
~~~

If the docs package entry remains absent, update the platform/Contracts package reference to a version that declares CW.Assistant.Extensions.Docs, then run the restore command again.

5. Read <ExtensionDocsRoot>/AGENT.md and follow its documented reading order. Read the required linked documents before implementing or reviewing extension code.


Completion requires an existing ExtensionDocsRoot containing AGENT.md, the exact docs package version sourced from the active project's property or restore metadata, and the AGENT.md reading order completed before code work begins.
